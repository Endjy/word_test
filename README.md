This is a super easy python program that helps me memorizing the word.
Simply create a txt file contenting the following format as base file:

word1 defination1,defination2
word2 defination1,defination2

The program will give random words from the base file to let the user text in the defination.
Finally the program will print out the test result for user to check the answer.
